I'm a computer science student at [ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/), a renowned engineering school in France specializing in aerospace and computer science. I'm passionate about the fields of theoretical computer science and aerospace, and I'm constantly seeking to deepen my knowledge in these fascinating areas.

## My Main Interests

- **Theoretical Computer Science:** I love delving into the abstract concepts of theoretical computer science, exploring formal languages, algorithmic complexity, and automata. Solving complex problems is my cup of tea, and I'm always open to new ideas in this field.

- **Aerospace:** My interest in aerospace drives me to explore the challenges of aerospace engineering, from fluid mechanics to space navigation systems. I dream of contributing to innovative projects in the aerospace domain someday.

## What You'll Find in My GitHub Profile

- Projects related to theoretical computer science, including algorithm implementations, solvers for complex problems, and examples of formal languages.

- Projects related to aerospace, such as flight simulations, trajectory analyses, and computational codes for space-related problems.

- Contributions to open-source projects, as I believe in collaboration and sharing knowledge.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out to me if you have project ideas, questions, or just want to discuss topics related to theoretical computer science or aerospace. You can find me on GitHub or contact me via email at [your@email.com](mailto:your@email.com).
